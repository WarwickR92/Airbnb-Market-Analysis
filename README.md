# Airbnb_Data_Analysis

This repository has been created for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course to put into practice the CRISP-DM process learnt throughout the course. In this repo we will examine data provided by Airbnb on both the Boston and Seattle markets to gain insights into the bussiness. The aim of this repository is to create meaningful insights to provide answers to core bussiness questions.

Using the Cross-Industry Standard for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) I will start by investigating both Airbnb as a company and looking into what mertics each dataset contains. This inital dive into the data should set the basis for the questions I will try to answer by giving me the Bussiness and Data Understanding needed to start the project. This will be performed in the first jupyter notebook called 'Initial_Data_Analysis.ipynb'

The five initial buissness questions are as follows:
1) Which market is most expensive Seattle or Boston?
2) Are the prices seasonal & which market has a larger seasonal trend?
3) Which property size metric influences prices most property type, property size, number of beds, number of rooms etc?
4) Is there any correlation between the setiment of the reviews in each city and the Airbnb prices? 
5) Can we use all of the above analysis be used to predict what a price should be for someone listing on Airbnb?
