# Airbnb_Data_Analysis

This repository has been created for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course to put into practice the CRISP-DM process learnt throughout the course. In this repo we will examine data provided by Airbnb on both the Boston and Seattle markets to gain insights into the bussiness. The aim of this repository is to create meaningful insights to provide answers to five core bussiness questions.

Using the Cross-Industry Standard for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) I will start by investigating both Airbnb as a company and looking into what mertics each dataset contains. This inital dive into the data should set the basis for the questions I will try to answer by giving me the Bussiness and Data Understanding needed to start the project. This will be performed in the first jupyter notebook called 'Initial_Data_Dive.ipynb'

The five initial buissness questions are as follows:
1. What are the busiest times of year for both the Seattle and Boston markets? 
2. In these busy periods which market becomes the most expensive?
3. Over time are these periods becoming more busy/expensive? Which one is growing at a faster rate?
4. Is there any correlation between the setiment of the reviews in each city and the growth in Airbnb prices?
5. Can we project how we think these prices will change in the future? Which market should Airbnb Invest more money?
